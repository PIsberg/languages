Inspiration from https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html

To keep it simple I used https://glot.io/ for running and compiling the code

010 Write a program that asks the user for her name and greets her with her name (printing, reading std-in)
020 Write function that reverses a list, preferably in place (liss, arrays)
030 Write a program that automatically converts English text to Morse code and vice versa (collections)
040 Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome (functions, string-manipulation, looping)
050 Write a program that reads a file and writes the content to another file (i/o)
060 Write a program that models an animal farm in OOP (animal, duck, sheep)
